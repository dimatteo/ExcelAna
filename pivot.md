# Tables #

-  To create a new pivot table just select the entire source raw table and then click on insert pivot table and by default you will have a nice new pivot table in a new worksheet
-  Make whatever you want by dragging around the observable, labels and filters (this is obvious)
-  To make new groups (very very useful) proceed as the following. Select cells, right click, then group. Iterate for all the groups you want. At the end, you will have a new field with the groups that can be nicely used for summaries
-  To rename the defalut group names simply put the new field in the Row Lables below and then change the field definition
-  To remove grouped field simpy ungroup everything (by selecting the field you have grouped)

# Charts #

-  Prep the table with observable, dependant variable and legend (very often your groups) 
-  Click on PivotChart options and simply create a chart (usually colored chart works best)
-  Second axis is simply obtained by right clicking on the legend entry name and selecting the option
